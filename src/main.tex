    \subsection{The Max Cut problem}

    The \tbf{Max Cut problem} --- in the unweighted case --- is a classic combinatorial optimization problem in the branch of \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory}{graph theory}, in which we seek to partition the vertices of an undirected graph into two disjoint subsets while maximizing the number of edges that have endpoints in both subsets. More formally, we will define a \tbf{cut} of a graph as follows.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Cut of a graph}
        Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, and a subset of its vertices $S \subseteq V$, the \tbf{cut} induced by $S$ on $G$ is defined as follows $$\mathrm{cut}(S) := \{e \in E \mid \abs{S \cap e} = 1\}$$
    \end{frameddefn}

    Note that in the definition above we are defining the cut of a graph through the intersection between a set of vertices $S$ and edges in $E$; this is because, in the undirected case, we will consider the edges of a graph $G = (V, E)$ as sets of 2 elements $$E = \{\{u, v\} \mid u, v \in V\}$$ Therefore, given a set of vertices $S$, the cut induced by $S$ is simply the set of edges that have only one endpoint in $S$ (implying that the other one will be in $V - S$).

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \begin{tikzpicture}[-,>=stealth,shorten >=1pt,auto,node distance=1.3cm, thick,main node/.style={scale=0.9,circle,draw,font=\sffamily\normalsize}]

            \node[circle, draw]  (1) []{};
            \node[circle, draw, fill=red]  (2) [below of = 1]{};
            \node[circle, draw, fill=red]  (3) [right of = 1]{};
            \node[circle, draw, fill=red]  (4) [below of = 3]{};

            % \path[every node/.style={font=\sffamily\small}]

            \draw[-] (1) [red] to (2);
            \draw[-] (1) [red] to (3);
            \draw[-] (2) to (4);
            \draw[-] (3) to (4);

            ;
        \end{tikzpicture}
        \caption{Given the set of red vertices $S$, the green edges represent $\mathrm{cut}(S)$.}
    \end{figure}

    With this definition, we can introduce the \tbf{Max Cut} problem, which is defined as follows.

    \begin{frameddefn}{Max Cut problem}
        Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, determine the set $S \subseteq V$ that maximizes $\abs{\mathrm{cut}(S)}$.
    \end{frameddefn}

    Although this problem is known to be \textsf{APX-Hard} \cite{maxcut}, approximation algorithms and heuristic methods like greedy algorithms and local search are commonly used to find near-optimal solutions.

    For now, we present the following \tbf{randomized algorithm}, which provides a straightforward $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation for the Max Cut problem. This algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves the approximation guarantee with high probability.

    \begin{framedalgo}{Random Cut}
        Given an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, the algorithm returns a cut of the graph. \\
        \hrule

        \quad
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Function{RandomCut}{$G$}
                \State $S := \varnothing$
                \For{$v \in V$}
                    \State Let $c_v$ be the outcome of the flip of an independent fair coin
                    \If{$c_v == \mathrm{heads}$}
                        \State $S = S \cup \{v\}$
                    \EndIf
                \EndFor
                \State \textbf{return} $S$
            \EndFunction
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{framedalgo}

    Note that this algorithm does not care about the structure of the graph in input, since the output is completely determined by the coin flips performed in the \texttt{for} loop. Now we will prove that this algorithm is a correct \tbf{expected $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation} of the Max Cut problem.
    
    \begin{framedthm}{Expected approximation ratio of \textsc{RandomCut}}
        Given a graph $G = (V, E)$, and an optimal solution $S^*$ to the Max Cut problem on $G$. Let $S = \textsc{RandomCut}(G)$; then, it holds that $$\mathbb E [\abs{\mathrm{cut}(S)}] \ge \dfrac{\abs{\mathrm{cut}(S^*)}}{2}$$
    \end{framedthm}

    \begin{proof}
        By definition, note that $$\forall e \in E \quad e \in \mathrm{cut}(S) \iff \abs{S \cap e} = 1$$ Consider an edge $e = \{v, w\} \in E$; then, by definition $$\{v, w\} \in \mathrm{cut}(S) \iff (v \in S \land w \notin S) \lor (v \notin S \land w \in S)$$ and let $\xi_1$ and $\xi_2$ be these last two events respectively. Then $$\Pr[\xi_1] = \Pr[c_v = \mathrm{heads} \land c_w = \mathrm{tails}]$$ by definition of the algorithm, and by independence of the flips of the fair coins we have that $$\Pr[\xi_1] = \Pr[c_v = \mathrm{heads}] \cdot \Pr[c_w = \mathrm{tails}] = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot \dfrac{1}{2} = \dfrac{1}{4}$$ Analogously, we can show that $$\Pr[\xi_2] = \dfrac{1}{4}$$ This implies that $$\Pr[e \in \mathrm{cut}(S)] = \Pr[\xi_1 \lor \xi_2] = \Pr[\xi_1] + \Pr[\xi_2] - \Pr[\xi_1 \land \xi_2] = \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{1}{4} - 0 = \dfrac{1}{2}$$ Hence, we have that $$\mathbb E [\abs{\mathrm{cut}(S)}] = \sum_{e \in E}{1 \cdot \Pr[e \in \mathrm{cut}(S)]} = \dfrac{\abs E}{2} \ge \dfrac{\abs{\mathrm{cut}(S^*)}}{2}$$ where the last inequality directly follows from the definition of cut of a graph.
    \end{proof}
